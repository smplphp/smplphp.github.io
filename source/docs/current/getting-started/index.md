# Installation {#installation}

SMPL PHP is a component based framework, where each component can function on its own. The individual components are still
in development, so there is no functioning framework at the moment. 

If you're interested in one of the components as a standalone package, you can take look at the 
[component documentation](/docs/current/components).
